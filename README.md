## Commands
The bot prefix is !
### !purge all
Purges everything. basically does all of the other purge commands
### !purge roles
Purges all roles and replaces them with new ones. Also gives everyone admin.
### !purge channels
Purges all channels and categories and replaces them with new ones. All channels also randomly go into a category
### !purge bans
Gets or makes invites, unbans everyone and attempts to send them to the banned users. This requires the banned person to be in another server with the REE6.

## Other Features
- The bot can also send you dms with invite links when it joins a server (must already be in a mutual server)
- The bot pings a random channel from a random server every second but it doesn't ping channels unless they were created when the bot is online and joined or if the bot restarts and is already in the server.
